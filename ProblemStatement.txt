Event Scheduling: 

Given a set of N events, e.g., events in college festival, each student is asked to choose M events 
of his/her choice, in order of decreasing reference. If there are K slots available to schedule the events out of which 
at most P slots can be held in parallel, output a schedule that maximizes the happiness of most students. You are free to
choose the definition of “happiness” as long as the definition is reasonable. The algorithm should work for any given
N, M, K, P and the preference list of any number of students.
